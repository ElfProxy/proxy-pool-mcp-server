## üìñ Overview

A privacy-first infrastructure solution combining dynamic IP rotation with AI-optimized web interaction capabilities. This integration enables secure, large-scale web data access for AI systems through two synergistic components:

**1. ElfProxy Dynamic IP Network**  
Global residential proxy infrastructure featuring:
- üåê 195+ country IP pools with city-level targeting
- üîÑ Automatic IP rotation (1s-24h adjustable intervals)
- üõ°Ô∏è Built-in TLS fingerprint masking
- ‚ö° Multi-protocol support (HTTP/SOCKS5/WebSocket)
- üìä Real-time traffic analytics dashboard

**2. Enhanced Model Context Protocol (MCP)**  
AI-specific web interaction layer with:
- üß† Context-aware request scheduling
- üñ•Ô∏è Headless browser rendering cluster
- ‚úÇÔ∏è Intelligent content sanitization (Ads/Trackers/Boilerplate removal)
- üîÑ 3-stage failover system (IP/Header/Protocol rotation)
- ‚è±Ô∏è Adaptive rate limiting (Requests/second auto-tuning)

## üí° Example Queries
When you've set up the MCP server with **Claude**, you can make requests like:

- Please extract a proxy IP address from the United States for me
- Accessing through a US proxy IP using `puppeteer`  ` https://www.amazon.de `

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **ElfProxy Account**: Please register an account in [ElfProxy](http://pyrn.2.vu/1/) first, contact ElfProxy customers, and obtain an apiKey (there will be 200MB of data available for trial use)

### üß© Server Configuration

The apiKey can be configured using the `application.yml` system property. 

### Cursor Tool Configuration

To use this MCP server in Cursor, add the following configuration to your Cursor settings:

```json
{
  "proxy-pool-server": {
    "url": "http://localhost:9000/sse",
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```

## Building

```bash
mvn clean package
```

## Running

```bash
java -jar target/proxy-pool-server-{version}.jar
```

## API Endpoints

The server exposes the following MCP tools:

- `getProxy`:Retrieve an IP address from the proxy pool and use the 'code' field to tell me which country's code you need. I will extract the IP address from the code and provide it to you
